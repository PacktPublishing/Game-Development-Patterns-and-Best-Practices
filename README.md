## About the Book
You’ve learned how to program, and you’ve probably created some simple games at some point, but now you want to build larger projects and find out how to resolve your problems. So instead of a coder, you might now want to think like a game developer or software engineer. To organize your code well, you need certain tools to do so, and that’s what this book is all about.

You will learn techniques to code quickly and correctly, while ensuring your code is modular and easily understandable.
